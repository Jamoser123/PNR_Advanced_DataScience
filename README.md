# PNR Advanced Data Science

A collection of hands-on Jupyter notebooks covering advanced data science topics specifically designed for healthcare professionals in the **MSc Precision Neurorehabilitation** program at Lake Lucerne Institute (LLUI).

## 📚 Topics Covered

- **Dimensionality Reduction** - Linear (PCA, MDS) and non-linear (t-SNE, UMAP) techniques for data visualization
- **Clustering** - Unsupervised learning and pattern discovery
- **Feature Selection** - Identifying relevant variables for predictive modeling  
- **Decision Trees** - Interpretable machine learning models
- **Classification** - Supervised learning for healthcare applications
- **Deep Learning** - Neural networks for complex pattern recognition

## 🎯 Target Audience

Healthcare professionals and students seeking to apply advanced data science techniques in clinical and research settings.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each notebook is **self-contained** and can be used independently:

1. Navigate to any topic folder
2. Open the HandsOn Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file)
3. Run the cells to follow the hands-on and get introduced to the different techniques, we always also show the techniques on medical datasets.
4. Open the Exercise Jupyter notebook to test your knowledge
5. Refer to the included helper functions as needed

## 📁 Repository Structure

There's one folder for each topic. Each folder contains:
- Hands-on notebook
- Exercise notebook
- Helper functions file
- Sample datasets

## 💡 Usage

No prior setup required - each notebook includes all necessary helper functions and can be run independently in any Jupyter environment.
